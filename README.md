# React DnD HTML5 Backend [![npm package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-dnd-html5-backend.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/react-dnd-html5-backend)

The officially supported HTML5 backend for [React DnD](http://gaearon.github.io/react-dnd/).  
See [the docs](http://gaearon.github.io/react-dnd/docs-html5-backend.html) for usage information.

## Installation

```
npm install --save react-dnd-html5-backend
```

While we suggest you to use NPM, you can find the precompiled UMD build in the `dist` folder available on the [`latest` branch](https://github.com/gaearon/react-dnd-html5-backend/tree/latest/dist) as well as in every [tagged release](https://github.com/gaearon/react-dnd-html5-backend/releases). This is where you can point Bower if thatâ€™s what you use.

There is no `dist` folder on the master branch.
